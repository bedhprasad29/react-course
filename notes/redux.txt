## React redux and Redux are different
  Redux : is core library
  React redux : is a bridge to connect react to redux

  Redux toolkit gives new features and functionalities that eases using redux

  First create a store using : configureStore({})
   - Every application should have only one store (Single Source of Truth)

  Crete a slice or call as features (which have reducers)
  createSlice({
    name: 
    initialState: 
    reducers: {
        func1: (state, action) => {
            // action.payload contains data send from useDispatch,
            // State is current value in initialState
            // if initialState is todos: push values using state.todos.push(todo)
        },
        func2: () => {},
    }
  })

  // react-redux has two methods : 
    useDispatch and useSelector

    - we can use reducers inside dispatch 

    To select values from store use : 
    const todos = useSelector(state => state.todos)


  // Diff in ContextAPI or Redux
  : in Redux state is preserved, and in ContextAPI it is not
